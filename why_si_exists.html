            <p class="ameat">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Spatial Inequality can exist for a lot of reasons.  One example of this is happening right now, in Brazil.  People who want better jobs, better healthcare, and housing are all moving from the rural areas to the cities.  However, these people usually don't have the right skill set for many jobs in the city, and also usually don't have very much money at all.<br>‎‎&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason spatial inequality exists is because people exploit other people.  An example of this is given in document 1, about "clandestine" workers(which means "kept in secret").  The owners of large monocultures(a farm growing only one type of crop) expel all the peasants from their lands, forcing them to live in "shantytowns".  They have nothing, so they are forced to return to the farm and work way below minimum wage.  They do this by <i>not</i> legally hiring the workers,u turning them into "clandestine" workers.  The balance becomes inequal:  The owner gets a lot of money, and the workers barley get enough to survive.</p>
